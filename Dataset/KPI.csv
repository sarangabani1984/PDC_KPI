Qualification tests to be performed, DVT followed by ORT on DVT tested HW

********************************
1. DVT test is required - 

All Qual Assemblies need to go through full MFG test (production test and capture yield report In spared sheet and add in MCO when initiated to add 2nd source MPNs

********************************

   c> Capture ORT test results (In spreadsheet when MCO is initiated to add 2nd source)

Additional information 
The On-going Reliability test (ORT) test is an extended reliability test which is performed under a single extreme corner case environmental condition. In general, the test will be an extended consumer-like traffic test (such as Line Rate JIT or Data Path Test) The test will not require any mastership switches, but instead will run entirely in the default mastership state as it would in a customers' environment.  If there are any product specific requirements that deviate from this process, they will be detailed in the product's test plan",Qualifying Maxim and Texas MPNs as additional sources.,44:11.0

C2. Qualification samples will be only new build. However, FGI may be used for qualification samples where the SKU being requested in the DEV has not had any demand 90 days after the DEV release date

** Qualification tests to be performed – DVT & Full MFG test ** 

-	DVT test is required - (Fully loaded the system with line cards under test) 
-	All Qual Assemblies need to go through full MFG test (production test and capture yield report In spared sheet and add in MCO when initiated to add 2nd source MPNs
-	Perform DVT per below  (whichever is applicable)
o	PROC-9980 for products FRS in 2020  OR 
o	PROC-8423 for products released before 2020 DVT in Fully loaded  system

Specific test: HOT swap / power cycle / system reboot (whichever applicable for each DUT) test to be perform 100 times at  25C, COLD and HOT for each DUT

C3.  Qualification units need to go through standard manufacturing and Test processes with the following specific actions:

- Install DEV-24935 on all Qual sample assemblies.
- Record all serial numbers with DEV label and put on the NO SHIP list
- Send the product test yield reports as soon as all units have completed Mfg tests to CM-DVT-   HTR reports CM-DVT-HTR-reports@juniper.net and the DEV Originator.  
- Ensure email header subject line indicates the Qual JPN, Qual MFR and the DEV#

C4. The qualification assemblies shall be shipped to Juniper (see Special Instructions) as soon as the required number of units have passed Mfg Test, prior to DVT.

C5. After completion of DVT, prepare and review HTR report with the Juniper On site TE team and then email to CM-DVT-HTR alias CM-DVT-HTR-reports@juniper.net. and the DEV Originator. Ensure email header subject line indicates the Qual JPN, Qual MFR and the DEV#.

New Qual Part(s) are from,

Qual MPN 1 & MFR 1 => MAX7310AUE+T & Maxim
Qual MPN 2 & MFR 2 => PCA9557PWR & Texas

A. Replace JPN: 310-013175 with above mentioned MPN(s) on the following as described in C

B.

C2. Qualification samples will be only new build. However, FGI may be used for qualification samples where the SKU being requested in the DEV has not had any demand 90 days after the DEV release date.

*********************************

Qualification tests to be performed, DVT followed by ORT on DVT tested HW

********************************
1. DVT test is required - 

All Qual Assemblies need to go through full MFG test (production test and capture yield report In spared sheet and add in MCO when initiated to add 2nd source MPNs

********************************

Perform DVT per below (whichever is applicable) 

  1. PROC-9980 for products FRS in 2020 OR 
  2. PROC-8423 for products released before 2020

Specific test:

**************
HOT swap / power cycle / system reboot (which ever applicable for each DUT) 
test to be perform 100 times at 25C, COLD and HOT for each DUT  	

**************
No SW Test required

*************
ORT test > Subset of On-going Reliability Test 

1. After DVT testing completed run Subset of On-going Reliability Test (ORT test per PROC-8989) use one full system to test these cards (you can piggyback with any other ORT test) Subset of On-going Reliability Test to be run  

***********

   a> run while the system is in a hot box at an elevated temperature, typically 40-45C.   
   b> The default test time will be 168 hours (1 week).  
   c> Capture ORT test results (In spreadsheet when MCO is initiated to add 2nd source)

Additional information 
The On-going Reliability test (ORT) test is an extended reliability test which is performed under a single extreme corner case environmental condition. In general, the test will be an extended consumer-like traffic test (such as Line Rate JIT or Data Path Test) The test will not require any mastership switches, but instead will run entirely in the default mastership state as it would in a customers' environment.  If there are any product specific requirements that deviate from this process, they will be detailed in the product's test plan",Qualifying Maxim and Texas MPNs as additional sources,55:34.0

1. QCS to proceed with the risk build and shipment after performing some reliability testing, inspection and rework. Please reference the attached QCS SOP document.
a. Perform 100% replacement of all Kangyang handles, further inspect/check for any cracks.
b. Using lower torque, rework/replace/mount the two screws for the handle using bigger diameter screw heads.
Reminder: Avoid multiple assembly/disassembly of screws as it will strip the threaded hole and screw will not have any material to bite into and get torqued.
c. Inspect the fully assembled handle into the power supplies under 20x magnification, check for cracks.  

2. QCS to perform additional tests on the above reworked power supplies.
a. Total of 50 samples, thermal cycling test using the profile described on Step-6, page 7 of the attached QCS SOP. After completion, inspect and report the results to Juniper.
b. Refer to filename: ""DCK22002-03 THERMAL CYCLING TEST REPORT FOR HANDLE CHECK.XLSX""in the Attachments folder.

511-180218:  Fab, PCB, Ardbeg RE board, Etch3, PTX-Ardbeg  

- Reason for Rev Up: To specify the CoP (Co-planarity requirement) across the cSTACK location in the current Fab dwg as per connector supplier (Amphenol's dwg) recommendation 

shows a max CoP of 0.08mm (~3 mils) across the entire cStack footprint pad array (~ 2"" long) and this is tighter than our PCB Workmanship Spec, so need to be noted on the fab dwg. so that Fab vendors can measure and make sure that they are inline with this CoP measurements and process the PCBs and there wont be no impact to actual PCBs or design

C2. Qualification boards will be new build or FGI.

C3. Qualification units need to go through standard manufacturing and Test processes with the following specific actions:
- Install DEV-25248 on all qual sample assemblies.
- Record all serial numbers with DEV label and put on the NO SHIP list.
- Send the product test yield reports as soon as all units have completed Mfg tests to CM-DVT-HTR-reports@juniper.net, mlemeshow@juniper.net and the DEV Originator.  
- Ensure email header subject line indicates the Qual DEV#, JPN, when shipped to Juniper testing. 

C4. The qualification assembly, not used for DVT, shall be shipped to Juniper (see Special Instructions) as soon as the required number of units have passed Mfg Test, prior to DVT.

C5. Perform DVT, as per the Accton Qual Plan.
Please email Accton Qual Plan to CM-DVT-HTR-reports@juniper.net and mlemeshow@uniper.net for Approval and copy DEV originator before performing DVT.  Once approved, Qual plan will be added to DEV.

C6. After completion of DVT, prepare and review HTR report. Email report to CM-DVT-HTR-reports@juniper.net, mlemeshow@juniper.net, and DEV Originator. Ensure email header subject line indicates the Qual JPN, Qual MFR and the DEV#.
